### Project Overview - tests

- A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that **the URL is not empty**.
- A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds **object and ensures it has a name defined** and that the **name is not empty**.
- A test that ensures **the menu element is hidden by default**. 
- A test that ensures **the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked**. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
- A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, **there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container**.
- A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that **the content actually changes**.
